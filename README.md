# My_CAR car service app

    This project is a mobile android app for following the car maintenance like
the service book, and collecting data to predict the next maintenance from previous
failures.
    The app has two parts: an android mobile app and an online server, the mobile
app for manage the user cars maintenance, and the server for authenticating the users
and syncing the local data (more description in implementation), and more important
for the application of the algorithms of machine learning (more description in chapter4).
    MyCAR app uses the concept of offline sync, it means that the mobile app works in local (offline) with a local database that saves all local data (cars, service centers,
maintenancesâ€¦).
